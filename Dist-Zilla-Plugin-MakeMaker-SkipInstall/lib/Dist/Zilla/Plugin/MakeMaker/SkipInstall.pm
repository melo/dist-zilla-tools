=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MakeMaker::SkipInstall - skip the install rule of MakeMaker

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your C<dist.ini> file:

    [MakeMaker::SkipInstall]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This small plugin will edit the C<Makefile.PL> file, and override the
install target to become a no-op.

This will make your module fail the install phase. It will be built, and
tested but will never be installed.

The most common use for this techinique is for L<Task> modules. Without
a proper install phase, you can install your Task module repetedly.


=head1 CREDITS

The technique was described by Marcel Gruenauer (hanekomu) in his
article "Repeatedly installing Task::* distributions":

L<http://hanekomu.at/blog/dev/20091005-1227-repeatedly_installing_task_distributions.html>

The author just wrapped the concept into a L<Dist::Zilla> plugin.
